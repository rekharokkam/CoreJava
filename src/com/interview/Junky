        Given an array of ints, return a new array of ints. In the returned array, the value in position n represents
        the product of all the array elements except for the array value at position n. So for a three element input
        array i, the output o should be as follows: o[0] = i[1] * i[2], o[1] = i[0] * i[2], o[2] = i[0] * i[1].
 
        Example:
        input: [1, 2, 3]     output: [6, 3, 2]
        input: [6, 9, 2, 6]  output: [108, 72, 324, 108]
